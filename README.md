# LISP-in-C---exercise

This repository is meant for the study of Gary D. Knott's Interpreting LISP. To be more precise, it is meant for studying the GOVOL LISP interpreter written in the C language in the final chapters of the book.

I plan to write the interpreter and work on the exercises alongside the SLISP revision(s) that I have begun planning and will start working on as soon as I get my new system ready. This project is an opportunity for me to delve deeper into the inner workings of a LISP system, for my SLISP interpreter is still rather basic and does not - and probably will never - include, for example, atom and number tables, garbage collection etc. It is also a great opportunity to re-familiarize myself with the basics of C programming language by using a practical exercise that is relevant to my own interests before I delve deeper into the inner workings of C itself.
