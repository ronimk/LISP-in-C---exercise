# LISP-in-C---exercise

This repository is meant for the study of Gary D. Knott's Interpreting LISP. To be more precise, it is meant for studying the GOVOL LISP interpreter written in the C language in the final chapters of the book.

I plan to write the interpreter and work on the exercises of the book. This project is an opportunity for me to delve deeper into the inner workings of a LISP system and gain a basic understanding of garbage collection among other things. It is also a great opportunity to re-familiarize myself with the C programming language by working on a project that is relevant to my interest in programming language design.

UPDATE:
The source code is done, even some of the exercises are done. The code is heavily (way too heavily) commented. I tried to gain a good understanding of the entire system while I was studying it, and this shows in the commented sections. 

TODO:
Finish the rest of the exercises.
Check for bugs&inprovements.
