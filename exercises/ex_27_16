TSETQ  sets the global variable of the given symbol to the given value.
(If the bind list for that symbol is empty, then Atab[symb].L is the global value for the symbol, so TSETQ sets it to the new value
If the bind list is not empty, TSETQ traverses through the bindlist of the symbol to find the last bind of that symbol,
which is the global value for the symbol and sets it to the new value given)
