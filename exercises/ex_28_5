garbage collecting atoms in the atom table feels really problematic. For example, how do we know when an atom is obsolete? Undefined atoms can be and are regularly
exploited in symbolic programming solely for their names, not for their values. Having pointers to undefined symbols in the atom table
garbage colleted and later replaced by other symbols will most probably break the entire program.
